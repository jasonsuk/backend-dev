### Set up
* npm install -g npm
* npm init -> package.json
* npm install `module_name` 
* npm install --save-dev `module_name` : __moduels for development__

    >> npm install -D 'nodemon' (also works)

** [NOTE] **
`node_modules` folder is created after installing modules, and is huge. When deploying it is suggested not to upload this. (DELETE IT!)

>> `npm install` command will help create node_modules for other users.
